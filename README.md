https://github.com/KyunghoLim/INST377_Final_Project
The website is targetted for every version of browser

The API I used for this project is the earthquake data from earthquake.usgs.gov
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2020-01-01&endtime=2020-01-02

The visuals used in my project shows the locations of the earthquake with the following detailed description of the earthquakes 
The visual used in this project is Leaflet which is a tool that allows us to create an interactive map.
For this project since it was not complete, I couldn't use any CSS frameworks but was planning to use Bootstrap.
The purpose of my project is to examin where, when, and how the earthquakes happen, how much damage they caused, and the magnitude of the earthquake. By searching up earthquakes on this website, it will give you information of where and when the earthquake happen and might give the user a sense of avoiding places where earthquake are frequently happening. The visual of the webpage will present the location of the earthquake following with the description of that earthquake such as place, time, coordination, magnitude, etc.
